# What is Universe?
Universe is an app to do pretty much everything, from running little bash/python scripts, to running terminal commands, all the way to browsing the web.

# Why create Universe?
Well, I've wanted something to do everything for a while now, and nothing I've found has met the specific needs that I have, which is why I started this project. Everyone is allowed to contribute, and contributions are encouraged.
