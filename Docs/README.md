# What is {Everything}?
{Everything} is an app to do pretty much everything, from running little bash/python scripts, to running terminal commands, all the way to browsing the web.

# Why is it called {Everything}?
The reason it's called {Everything} is because at the moment, I don't have a name for it (suggestions welcome, why not open an issue and suggest - and get your green square.) Once a name is selected, I will be changing it to the name, the squiggly brackets are being used to show that it is being changed.

# Why create {Everything}?
Well, I've wanted something to do everything for a while now, and nothing I've found has met the specific needs that I have, which is why I started this project. Everyone is allowed to contribute, and contributions are encouraged.
